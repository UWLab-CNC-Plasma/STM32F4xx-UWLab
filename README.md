# STM32F4xx grblHAL driver (UWLab Fork)

## Overview
This is a custom fork of grblHAL for STM32F4xx, modified to support a 2-axis CNC plasma cutting system developed for the ME 481/482 capstone project at the University of Waterloo. These modifications adapt grblHAL to the specific needs of our plasma cutter by adjusting configuration settings and improving safety behavior.

## Key Modifications
- **Machine Configuration**: Adjusted settings for our CNC plasma cutter, including:
  - `Spindle` configured as an on/off output.
  - `Probe` functionality disabled (not needed for our machine).
- **Custom Core (core-UWLab)**:
  - Replaced `grblHAL/core` with a modified fork (`core-UWLab`).
  - Changed Feed Hold behavior so that it stops the spindle (torch) as well, even when not in laser mode.

## Building and Installation
- Built and uploaded using **PlatformIO in VS Code**.
- Follow the original repositoryâ€™s build instructions for setup details.
